# Equanimity_PortListener
C++ code to create a port listener on Windows 10. 
One application of this code could involve the remote connection of weather data from a PV-solar powered device. If the connection is ever lost, that could suggest power outage or equipment failure.
Setup requires advanced firewall, port-forward configuration, and software compilation skills.
Tested locally with Firefox. Tested public access with YouGetSignal's port check tool.
I learned that web browsers open multiple connections to request multiple resources at once. Interesting stuff.
